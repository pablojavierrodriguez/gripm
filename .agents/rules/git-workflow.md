# Git Workflow & Commit Governance

Strict rules governing Git operations to prevent unintentional code loss or vague commit histories.

---

## Explicit Verbal Authorization Required

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER execute git commits or pushes without explicit, verbal permission from the user for EACH action.**

- **Never Infer Permissions:** Previous approval of a commit or push NEVER grants tacit approval for subsequent actions.
- **Task Words Are NOT Commit Permission:** Words like *"looks good"*, *"ok"*, *"proceed"*, *"go ahead"*, or *"done"* mean **implement or edit the code only**, NEVER run `git commit` or `git push`.
- **Explicit Keyword Rule:** Every commit and every push requires an individual message containing the explicit word *"commit"* or *"push"*.

---

## Descriptive and Structured Commit Messages

- **No Generic Messages:** Vague commits (e.g., *"fix bugs"*, *"update files"*, *"wip"*) are strictly forbidden.
- **Structured Commit Anatomy:**
  - **Header:** Meaningful title following Conventional Commits (`feat(...)`, `fix(...)`, `refactor(...)`, `docs(...)`).
  - **Body:** When a commit touches multiple areas, include a structured bulleted summary detailing the exact scope of changes so anyone outside the team understands what was changed and why.

## Multi-Agent Parallelism via git worktree

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never run `git checkout` in a shared repository while another agent is working.** The working tree and `.git/HEAD` represent shared filesystem state, not per-session isolation. A `checkout` run by one agent silently switches the other agent's branch **while it is actively writing**.

The two failure modes this causes:

1. **Commits on the wrong branch.** Agent A runs `git commit` after Agent B switched branches, landing A's changes on top of B's work.
2. **Unstaged changes blocking or corrupting the other agent's checkout.**

### Rule & Discovery Protocol (Pre-Flight Concurrency Probe)

Before running any Git command or modifying files:
1. **Synchronous Probe:** The agent inspects the backlog (`status: doing`) and runs `git status --porcelain`. If it detects an item in `doing` with a `claimed_by` different from its own namespaced identity (`<provider>:<id>`), it **dynamically discovers an active peer**.
2. **Shared Tree Safeguard:** Prohibited to run `git checkout .`, `git restore .`, or `git clean`. The agent assumes uncommitted changes belong to its peer.
3. **Autonomous Handshake & Cross-Harness Protocol:**
   - **Intra-Harness (same runtime, e.g., `antigravity:`):** Issues a `send_message` to the `claimed_by` recipient of the active task to coordinate priorities.
   - **Cross-Harness (different provider, e.g., `cursor:`, `claude-code:`, `human:`):** Respects the lease without attempting unviable RPC calls, notifies the user in chat, and proceeds directly to worktree isolation.
4. **Worktree Isolation:** When two or more agents operate simultaneously on the same repository, **each agent or parallel task operates in its own worktree**. No agent changes branches in the primary working tree.

### Recipe

```bash
# create isolated worktree and its branch in a single command
git worktree add -b <branch> ../<repo>-<task>

# navigate into worktree
cd ../<repo>-<task>
# ... complete task with its own branch and isolated working tree ...

# consolidate changes BEFORE removing the worktree
# (executed from main worktree, with integration in flight)
git fetch . <branch>:dev          # integrates into dev without branch switching
git worktree remove ../<repo>-<task>
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **`-b` is not optional.** `git worktree add ../<repo>-<task> <branch>` fails with `fatal: invalid reference` if the branch does not already exist, and creating it requires `git checkout -b` in the primary working tree - the exact operation this rule forbids. The isolation recipe cannot be followed without violating the rule it serves.
>
> Consolidation uses `git fetch . <branch>:dev` **precisely to avoid `git checkout`**: running `git checkout dev && git merge <branch>` contradicts the prohibition against switching branches in the primary working tree.

Audit & cleanup:

```bash
git worktree list                 # inspect active worktrees
git worktree prune                # clean references to manually deleted worktrees
```

### Coexistence Rules

- **One branch per worktree.** Git does not permit two worktrees to share the same branch: this is a core design constraint, not a preference.
- **The primary worktree stays on `dev`.** It serves as the integration trunk. Agents do not check out branches there.
- **`git worktree remove` does not delete uncommitted changes.** If an agent terminates without consolidating, manually remove the worktree only after verifying no uncommitted work is lost.
- **Parallel sub-agents:** if multiple sub-agents touch overlapping files, each operates in its own worktree. Working tree isolation **does not** isolate conflicting lines: two agents editing the same file will still conflict upon merge. See `.agents/TEAM_PLAYBOOK.md`.

## Consolidated Task Commits & Clean Releases

- **Consolidated Cadence:** 1 verified task in `ready` = 1 clean, atomic commit including the code and its associated task specification file (e.g. `[TASK-ID] - slug.md` or issue link). Do not create noisy micro-commits during scratch work or exploration.
- **Pre-Commit Enforcement:** Ensure pre-commit verification hooks pass cleanly (typecheck, tests, backlog sync) before completing commits.
- **No Stealth Commits:** Never chain hidden or stealth commits. Maintain explicit task ID in commit title (`feat([TASK-ID]): ...` or `fix([TASK-ID]): ...`).
