# Multi-Agent Team Playbook - Agile Autonomous Framework

This playbook establishes a collaborative, autonomous operating loop between specialized agent roles and human leads to build and maintain high-grade software products.

> **Source of truth for states:** the delivery status vocabulary and its transitions are defined once, in [STATE_MACHINE.md](STATE_MACHINE.md). This document references it and must never redefine the state table.

## 🚦 Default Entry Point & Dynamic Decision Matrix

**Default Conversation Role:** Every conversation thread defaults to the **[`pm-orchestrator`](skills/pm-orchestrator/SKILL.md)** as the host agent talking to the user, **unless** the user explicitly invokes another role or skill directly (e.g., *"act directly as Principal Engineer"*).

The user never has to manually specify when to trigger a sprint or which sub-agent to spawn. The `pm-orchestrator` automatically classifies incoming requests into one of three operating tracks and dispatches the required sub-agents:

| Operating Track | Typical Triggers | Execution & Sub-Agent Topology | Overhead / Documentation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mode 1: Surgical Focus** *(Fast-Track)* | Targeted bugfixes, calculations/invariants, copy/typo tweaks, linter fixes, failing unit tests. | **Host Orchestrator** applies [`principal-engineer`](skills/principal-engineer/SKILL.md) rules directly (or via 1 focused sub-agent). If certifying a backlog item (`review` ➔ `ready`), spawns a clean-context [`qa-auditor`](skills/qa-auditor/SKILL.md) sub-agent. | **Zero bureaucracy.** No sprint doc. Atomic modification + verification (`typecheck` + tests). |
| **Mode 2: Tactical Duo** *(UX + Engineering)* | Component redesign, new modals/sheets, ergonomics & touch targets, visual charts. | **Host (`pm-orchestrator`)** dispatches clean-context sub-agents: **[`product-designer`](skills/product-designer/SKILL.md)** ➔ **[`principal-engineer`](skills/principal-engineer/SKILL.md)** ➔ **[`qa-auditor`](skills/qa-auditor/SKILL.md)**. | **Lightweight.** Plan outlined directly in chat. No sprint doc unless touching database schema. |
| **Mode 3: Full Sprint & Backlog Flow** | Major backlog feature, database schema migrations, complex business workflows. | **Host (`pm-orchestrator`)** orchestrates isolated sub-agents: **[`market-researcher`](skills/market-researcher/SKILL.md)** ➔ **[`product-designer`](skills/product-designer/SKILL.md)** ➔ **[`principal-engineer`](skills/principal-engineer/SKILL.md)** (SDD) ➔ **[`qa-auditor`](skills/qa-auditor/SKILL.md)** ➔ **Release Management**. | **Formal.** Tracked via backlog task or sprint spec, verified through the Verification Pyramid and packaged by value. |

## 🤖 Sub-Agent Context Isolation & Handoff Contracts

A single LLM thread that writes code and then "pretends" to be the QA Auditor in the same context window suffers from **confirmation bias**: it inherits its own assumptions, excuses, and blind spots. To eliminate roleplay theatre, this framework enforces **Context Isolation via Sub-Agents (`invoke_subagent`)**:

> **"Orchestrate from the hub; isolate execution and verification in clean sub-agent contexts."**

### 📋 Mandatory Sub-Agent Handoff Matrix

When the host `pm-orchestrator` delegates to a specialist via `invoke_subagent`, the sub-agent runs in a **fresh context window** and receives an explicit **Handoff Contract**:

| Sub-Agent Role | Harness Invocation (`invoke_subagent`) | Skill Required to Read First | Clean Input Provided by Orchestrator | Mandatory Output Returned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market Researcher** | `TypeName: "research"`<br>`Workspace: "inherit"`<br>*(Read-only + Web search)* | [`.agents/skills/market-researcher/SKILL.md`](skills/market-researcher/SKILL.md) | Problem statement + domain + specific UX/API questions. | `[RESEARCH]` brief: >= 3 product benchmarks, filtered domain edge-case table, and concrete recommendations. |
| **Product Designer** | `TypeName: "research"` *(or `"self"` if generating visual assets)*<br>`Workspace: "inherit"`<br>*(Read-first design specification)* | [`.agents/skills/product-designer/SKILL.md`](skills/product-designer/SKILL.md) | Problem statement + ACs + Research brief + project design tokens. | `[DESIGN SPEC]`: semantic tokens, >= 44×44px touch targets, all 7 interactive states, Purpose Test verdicts, and copy veracity check. |
| **Principal Engineer** | `TypeName: "self"`<br>`Workspace: "inherit"` *(or `"share"` in parallel SDD)*<br>*(Full write + Terminal tools)* | [`.agents/skills/principal-engineer/SKILL.md`](skills/principal-engineer/SKILL.md) | Refined task (`doing`) + ACs + Design Spec + Architecture boundaries + files in scope + `.agents/rules/`. | Implemented modular code (< 1000 LOC per file, layers decoupled), checked ACs (`- [x]`), green local typecheck/tests, Honest Scope & Residual Risk Declaration (what was not tested + residual risk), task in `review`. |
| **QA Auditor** *(NEVER in the coder's thread)* | `TypeName: "self"`<br>`Workspace: "inherit"`<br>*(Contract-bounded: NO source code edits, terminal execution only)* | [`.agents/skills/qa-auditor/SKILL.md`](skills/qa-auditor/SKILL.md) & [`.agents/skills/code-level-ux-auditor/SKILL.md`](skills/code-level-ux-auditor/SKILL.md) | **Blind audit payload only:** Task file path (ACs) + `git diff` (or commit range) + command to run `node scripts/gate-qa.mjs <ID>`. Zero developer rationalization history. | `[QA MATRIX]`: mechanical `gate:qa` exit code + blind semantic audit of `git diff` vs. ACs + verdict (`APPROVED -> ready` or `REJECTED -> doing` with file:line findings). |

### 🟢 When to Parallelize (Sub-Agents / Background Tasks):
1. **Blind QA Certification (`qa-auditor`):**
   - **Always isolated** in a fresh sub-agent context so verification is unbiased by the implementation conversation.
2. **Exploratory Research & Benchmarking (`market-researcher`):**
   - Investigate industry references (Linear, Stripe, Notion, Obsidian) or analyze external API documentation without polluting the core technical context.
3. **Accessibility (a11y) & Static Code Audits (`code-level-ux-auditor`):**
   - Execute contrast ratios, accessibility checks, or static UX scans (`node scripts/audit-ux-code.cjs`) asynchronously.
4. **Auditing Visual Layouts (`browser_subagent`):**
   - Reserved **exclusively** for visual layout/CSS issues not deducible statically, complex viewport rendering, or upon explicit user request.

### 🔴 When to Keep STRICT SEQUENTIAL WRITER FOCUS (One Active Mutator at a Time):
1. **Domain Logic & State Invariants:**
   - Core business logic, central state stores, and data integrity require strict sequential reasoning. Never spawn two concurrent coder sub-agents mutating the same domain store at the same time.
2. **Database Schemas & Migrations:**
   - Schema foundations, migrations, and Row-Level Security (RLS) policies must be designed and validated sequentially to guarantee idempotence.
3. **Core Architectural Refactoring & Backlog Parsers:**
   - Backlog sync engines, parsers, and global context providers require end-to-end coherence.

### 🔁 Subagent-Driven Development (SDD)

A single thread executing an extensive implementation plan suffers from **context degradation**: it forgets early instructions, conflates states, reintroduces regressions in previously passing tests, and resorts to improvised patching. SDD is the architectural antidote for high-complexity tasks.

**1. Context-Resilient Execution Plans.** The `pm-orchestrator` decomposes work into **hyper-atomic, independent steps**. Each step is specified under Red-Green TDD with explicit, self-contained instructions: a `principal-engineer` sub-agent with a fresh context must be able to execute it without divergence. The step explicitly declares targeted files, expected behavior, and verification criteria.

**2. Fresh Sub-Agent Per Step.** The orchestrator does **not** code the entire feature in the host thread. It dispatches a fresh sub-agent for step N (`TypeName: "self"`), operating on the working tree (`Workspace: "inherit"`) or in isolation (`Workspace: "share"` / isolated worktree, see § Workspace Isolation).

**3. Sequential Supervision & Consolidation.** The orchestrator reviews the resulting diff, executes headless verification, and **only when green** consolidates changes and triggers step N+1. A builder sub-agent is never spawned in parallel with another mutating the same files. Upon completing all steps and transitioning to `review`, the orchestrator dispatches the `qa-auditor` sub-agent in a clean context to certify.

> [!CAUTION]
> Multi-step SDD is intended for **high-complexity tasks**. For a targeted bugfix (Mode 1), it is over-engineering: apply the Honest Scope principle - organizational structure exists when the problem warrants it, not by default.

### 🔒 Workspace Isolation & Autonomous Inter-Agent Coordination (IACP)

When two or more agents or sub-agents work on the same repository at the same time, **each one operates in its own git worktree on its own branch**, and nobody runs `git checkout` in the main working tree. `.git/HEAD` and the working tree are shared filesystem state: a cross-checkout silently switches the other agent's branch *while it is writing*, and its next commit lands on the wrong branch.

> [!TIP]
> In environments with native sub-agent support (such as Antigravity), workspace isolation can be enabled by setting `Workspace: "share"` in `invoke_subagent` (creating a workspace sharing the underlying repository similar to a Git worktree without duplicating storage). For manual workflows or external agents, use the canonical `git worktree add` recipe.

#### 🤝 Dynamic Peer Discovery & Handshake Protocol

To prevent agents from colliding blindly or requiring human intervention as an information relay:

1. **Pre-Flight Concurrency Probe (Synchronous & Mandatory):**  
   Before editing code or altering branches, every newly invoked agent inspects the backlog for items with `status: doing` and runs `git status --porcelain`.  
   - If it detects an item in `doing` with a `claimed_by` different from its own identity, or uncommitted changes (`A `, `M `) in `git status --porcelain` not authored by the current session, it **dynamically discovers an active peer or foreign in-flight changes**.
   - **Shared Tree Safeguard & Mandatory Isolation:** Prohibited to execute `git checkout .`, `git restore .`, or `git clean` on a working tree with in-flight changes from another agent. The detecting agent immediately self-isolates in a worktree.
2. **Dynamic Task Claiming Namespaced (`claimed_by`):**  
   When moving an item to `status: doing`, the agent atomically stamps its complete identity in the YAML frontmatter under the canonical format `<provider_or_harness>:<session_or_agent_id>`:
   - `antigravity:7e5f1a7d-1f19-46fd-bb33-baa4c0394372`
   - `cursor:composer-b82f1...`
   - `claude-code:session_01...`
   - `copilot:run-4819...`
   - `human:<username>`  
   The item in `doing` serves as the Single Source of Truth for the active lease.
3. **Autonomous Peer Handshake & Cross-Harness Protocol:**  
   - **Intra-Harness (same runtime, e.g., `antigravity:` to `antigravity:`):** Issues a direct message (`send_message` with `Recipient: claimed_by`) announcing its presence and scope to coordinate or sequence work autonomously without human intermediation.
   - **Cross-Harness (heterogeneous providers, e.g., Antigravity detecting `cursor:...` or `human:...`):** The agent recognizes the messaging boundary, avoids failing RPC calls, respects the active lease, immediately self-isolates in its own `git worktree`, and notifies the user in chat.
4. **Auto-Branching in Worktree:**  
   If tasks touch disjoint areas, the second agent **never touches the main working tree**: it automatically creates an isolated worktree (`git worktree add -b <branch> ../<repo>-<task>`) and consolidates upon completion.

> [!CAUTION]
> **A worktree isolates the working tree, not the content.** Two agents editing the same file still collide at merge time. Filesystem isolation is not an integration strategy: when several items touch the same documents (`AGENTS.md`, `TEAM_PLAYBOOK.md`, `STATE_MACHINE.md`, a shared `SKILL.md`, CI/CD pipelines, or releases), sequence them or split the scope per file *before* parallelizing.

## 🔄 The Agile Delivery Flow (The 5 Phases)

```

Transitions, actors, and guards are specified in [STATE_MACHINE.md](STATE_MACHINE.md).

### Phase 1: Briefing & Alignment (PM Orchestrator / PO)
- **Input:** Backlog item or user requirement.
- **Action:** Initializes task or sprint spec using `docs/sprints/SPRINT_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md`. Refines the item until it passes the **refinement gate (R1)**: problem statement, scoped in/out, measurable ACs, priority, and architecture readiness (boundaries and contracts established if none exist).
- **Output:** Clear problem statement, target personas, and measurable acceptance criteria (ACs).

### Phase 2: Benchmarking & Experience Design (Researcher + Designer)
- **Action:** Analyzes world-class benchmarks (Linear, Notion, GitHub Projects) and specifies visual tokens, responsive behavior, and touch ergonomics (≥ 44px).
- **Output:** Populates design spec, interactive states, and edge-case handling.

### Phase 3: Dev Execution (`doing` ➔ `review`) (Principal Engineer)
- **Action:** Implements modular, strictly typed code adhering to domain invariants. **Architecture-First:** establishes module boundaries and public contracts before coding if undefined. **Strict Modularity:** enforces hard ceiling of < 1000 LOC per file (target 150 - 500 LOC) and separates presentation, business logic, and infrastructure (zero God-Files). Claims the item by moving it `draft` ➔ `doing` - only after the refinement gate passed.
- **Ticking ACs:** Checks off acceptance criteria in real-time (`- [x]`).
- **Output:** Passes the item to `status: review` upon completing implementation and local testing. **Cannot self-certify:** moving to `ready` is exclusive to the QA Auditor.

### Phase 4: QA Gate (`review` ➔ `ready`) - Formal Handover in a Clean-Context Sub-Agent (QA Auditor)
- **Mandatory Clean-Context Sub-Agent:** The thread that implemented the code **never** executes Phase 4. The `pm-orchestrator` spawns an isolated [`qa-auditor`](skills/qa-auditor/SKILL.md) sub-agent (`invoke_subagent`) with a clean context window, passing only the task path (ACs) and the `git diff`.
- **Action:** The QA sub-agent audits the item using the **Verification Pyramid (Zero-Waste Testing)** in strict sequence:
  1. ✅ `tsc --noEmit` / `npm run validate` (strict typing & repo consistency, 0 errors)
  2. ✅ Unit & integration tests (`npm test`, headless code 0)
  3. ✅ Backlog & spec consistency checks
  4. ✅ Production build (`npm run build`)
  5. ✅ `node scripts/audit-ux-code.cjs --strict` (static UX audit, headless)
- **Blind Semantic Diff Audit:** Beyond mechanical checks, the clean-context QA sub-agent verifies that every checked AC (`- [x]`) is genuinely implemented in the `git diff`, with no module-wide `vi.mock()` evasions, no `as unknown as` type escapes, strict modularity (zero files >= 1000 LOC, zero God-Files bundling multi-layer logic), and all mandatory headless audits satisfied.
- **Anti-Browser-Subagent Inefficiency:** Prohibited to invoke `browser_subagent` for logic, state, API contracts, or persistence that can be audited in milliseconds headlessly. Reserved strictly for static-undeducible CSS/layout issues or explicit user prompt.
- **Output:** Once both `node scripts/gate-qa.mjs <ID>` (`exit 0`) and the blind diff audit pass, moves the item to `status: ready`. On failure, records actionable findings (`file:line`) and moves it back to `doing` (transition T3).
- **`ready` is the formal delivery of development**: the item is validated and immediately eligible for packaging and deployment. A certified item is frozen: any post-QA code change invalidates the certification and requires a return to `doing`.

#### Double Gate: Mechanical Runner + Blind Sub-Agent

> **Neither prose nor same-thread roleplay is a gate.** An agent asked to "act as the QA Auditor" in the same turn that it wrote the code will tick the ACs by inertia and rationalize its own shortcuts. This playbook prevents both failure modes: `scripts/gate-qa.mjs` enforces the mechanical gate (**exit code 0**), and **context isolation (`invoke_subagent`)** enforces an unbiased semantic audit of the `git diff`.

```bash
node scripts/gate-qa.mjs TASK-ID                    # full mechanical gate
node scripts/gate-qa.mjs TASK-ID --no-run  # inspection only; exits 2, never certifies
```

The runner rejects, mechanically: an item not in `review`; any unchecked acceptance criterion; a `blocked_reason` that is missing, empty or whitespace on a `blocked` item (and a stray `blocked_reason` on an item that is not blocked); and any declared dependency that is missing from disk or not in `done`. It then runs the pyramid, and a step that cannot execute is reported `SKIPPED` - **a pyramid where nothing ran fails the gate rather than passing it**, because certification on an unexecuted gate is the exact theatre this runner exists to prevent.

Running the gate is necessary (`exit 0`) and the clean-context QA Auditor sub-agent issues the final verdict after auditing the `git diff` against the ACs.

#### `blocked`: registering an impediment

A task that cannot proceed is moved to `status: blocked` with a **non-empty `blocked_reason`** in its frontmatter, rather than being left to rot in `doing` where it inflates WIP and nobody remembers why it stopped. It returns to `doing` or `draft` only when the impediment is resolved or its blocking dependencies reach `done` or are explicitly unlinked. The invariant is enforced by the runner, not by discipline.

### Phase 5: Release Management & Prod Implementation (`ready` ➔ `done`)
- **Packaging by Delivered Value:** Release Management (PO + Scrum/Delivery Lead) groups available items in `ready` based on value delivered.
- **Decoupled Sprints & Releases:** Sprints and releases have no 1:1 coupling. Releases are created based on delivered value with any available `ready` items (historical or from the active sprint), with or without an active sprint.
- **Production Deployment (`done`):** Upon committing and pushing the release package to production (main cloud), the packaged items transition to `status: done`.
- **Fundamental Invariant:** **No item can exist in production that is not in `done`**.

## ⏱️ Sprint Lifecycle & PO Sovereignty

1. **Fixed Timebox:** A sprint concludes when its scheduled timebox expires (fixed duration), regardless of whether all planned items are finished. Incomplete items are replanned to the next sprint or returned to the backlog.
2. **Continuous Productivity:** If all items in a sprint are completed before the timebox expires, the PO expands the sprint scope by pulling in newly refined backlog items to maintain productivity. Sprints rarely conclude prematurely.
3. **No Autonomous Close or Retro:** The AI agent **NEVER** closes a sprint or executes a retrospective autonomously by deduction. Both actions require explicit, textual instructions from the PO (e.g., *"close the sprint"*, *"run the sprint retro"*).
4. **Mandatory Retro Outputs:** Update rules in `AGENTS.md`, refine skills, and create backlog tasks for all identified technical debt or process improvements.

---

## 🧠 Continuous Learning Protocol (Knowledge Feeder)

At the conclusion of each release or sprint:
1. **New UI or input discoveries:** Documented into relevant design/form skills.
2. **Superior architectural patterns:** Documented as an Architectural Decision Record (ADR).
3. **No bug or friction is solved twice:** Converted into a permanent project rule in `AGENTS.md`.
